custom radio for plex music
(I need a better name for this)

## what?
this project creates custom playqueues of your plex music based on complex rules you can define.
for example: "play a mix of songs I've heard and ones I haven't, preferring songs I haven't heard, and use sonic analysis to make sure each song flows into the next"

## why?
I love Plex's radio functions and Plexamp's Guest DJs, but i want _more_ control. specifically I wanted to create the first example above - I wanted to shuffle tracks I've never heard into a queue of tracks I know I like, using sonic analysis data to make sure they flow well.
